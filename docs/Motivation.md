# Motivation

Small Improvements builds a product that makes feedback happen at companies. The software enables a company and its people to grow with feedback and company and inidividual objectives. It is a continous loop between giving feedback and contributing to an individual goal. It allows you to grow as an individual in a company yet helps the company to focus on long term objectives.

Customers of Small Improvements range from 20 to 2000 people. When so many people set up short and long term objectives or write feedback about each other, a lot of data (ist im umlauf). Managers and the human resource department are keen to explore this data. It is our duty as developers to show all of this data the most accesible way.

Back in the days Small Improvements migrated from Angular to React. The migration came with the drawback that many of the components had to be rewritten. Thus the way to show a lot of data would be a requirement in React too.

In Angular there was a component to show the data. It was a rigid solution that nobody wanted to touch anymore. Basically, like you would have been used in Angular, it came with one monstrousous configuration object.

In React, as everyone would want to, we wanted to make it better. According to the React way we wanted to keep it composeable, reusabled and simple in its usage. We were convinced by our approach to solve the problem and wanted to enable everyone to use the solution.
