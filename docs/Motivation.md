Small Improvements builds a product that makes feedback happen at companies. The software enables a company and its people to grow with feedback and objectives. It is a continuous loop between giving feedback and contributing to a goal. It allows you to grow as an individual in a company yet helps the company to focus on long term objectives.

Customers of Small Improvements range from 20 to 2000 people. When so many people set up short and long term objectives or write feedback about each other, a lot of data is available. The human resource department and managers are keen to explore this data. As developers, it is our duty to make all of this data accessible.

Back in the days Small Improvements migrated from Angular to React. The migration came with the drawback that many of the components had to be rewritten. Thus the way to show a lot of data would be a requirement in React too.

In Angular there Small Improvements had a component to show the data. It was a rigid solution that nobody wanted to touch anymore. Basically, like you would have been used in Angular, it came with one monstrousness configuration object to show a table component.

In React, as everyone would want to, we wanted to make it better. According to the React way we wanted to keep it composeable, reusable and simple in its usage. We came up with a solution for ourselves to make the data available with all desired functionalities. Since we were convinced that the solution would be beneficial for everyone, we wanted to open source it.
