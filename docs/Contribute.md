# Contribute

Please let us know if you have any feedback. You can create Issues to give feedback or to contribute improvements. We don't want to encourage you to add new enhancements from the beginning. Instead you can experiment with your own enhancements and open source them eventually with a Pull Request. In the beginning, it would be great to improve the core of the library to make it more robust.

Our primary goals are:

* exceptional test coverage for the core functionalities
* functionality to use custom styles (e.g. row selected style, general row style, pagination style)
* performance (e.g. usage of shouldComponentUpdate), because there were no performance optimizations made yet

## Installation
